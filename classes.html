    <h2>Relax anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>
        Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your<br>
        eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll<br>
        on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a<br>
        prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
